This is (presumably) the original #GoogleManifesto, #GoogleMemo document
with all graphs and links intact. This is _not_ the version of the
document that was posted on Gizmodo which--we now know in
retrospect--was redacted and incomplete.

I obtained this document by following the link in the following tweet.

<https://twitter.com/__ice9/status/894746554283642880>

The tweet's thread indicates that this version of the document came from
the Vice Motherboard site.

That thread also cites an interesting essay at the Slate Star Codex,
which discusses gender differences across different countries.

Finally, note that James Damore now has his own site where he publishes
(a perhaps updated?) version of the document.
